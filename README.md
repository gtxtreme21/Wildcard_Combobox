# Wildcard_Combobox
# Author: Gary Tipton

Wildcard jquery combobox is the same as the regular jquery comobo box v. 1.12 except it also provides wild card search functionality 
if using the wild card funciton override.  Please see the html for an example of how to use this tool.

Please note that this code is a modification of the existing jquery combobox: https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html

Thanks for looking,
